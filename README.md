## Gitlab RCE version < 13.10.3

RCE exploit for gitlab version < 13.10.3
Root cause:
- When uploading image files, Gitlab Workhorse passes any files with the extensions jpg|jpeg|tiff through to ExifTool to remove any non-whitelisted tags.
- One of the supported formats is DjVu. When parsing the DjVu annotation, the tokens are evaled to "convert C escape sequences".
```
# convert C escape sequences (allowed in quoted text)
$tok = eval qq{"$tok"};
```
